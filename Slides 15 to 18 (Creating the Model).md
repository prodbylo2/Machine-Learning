This code tackles the Fashion MNIST image classification task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Data Loading (In [30])**

- `(X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()`: This line loads the Fashion MNIST dataset using the `keras.datasets` module. It returns two tuples:
    - The first tuple contains the training data: `X_train_full` (images) and `y_train_full` (labels).
    - The second tuple contains the testing data: `X_test` (images) and `y_test` (labels).

**2. Data Splitting (In [30])**

- This section splits the training data into two sets: training and validation. Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.
    - `X_train, X_valid = X_train_full[:-5000], X_train_full[-5000:]`: This splits the training images `X_train_full` into training (`X_train`) and validation (`X_valid`) sets. It takes the last 5000 images from `X_train_full` for validation.
    - `y_train, y_valid = y_train_full[:-5000], y_train_full[-5000:]`: Similarly, it splits the training labels `y_train_full` into training (`y_train`) and validation (`y_valid`) sets based on the same split as the images.

**3. Data Preprocessing (In [30])**

- This part prepares the data for training by performing standardization.
    - `X_mean = X_train.mean(axis=0, keepdims=True)`: Calculates the mean value of each pixel across all training images (`X_train`). The `axis=0` specifies calculating the mean across the entire first dimension (samples). `keepdims=True` ensures the output remains a 2D array with the mean values for each pixel.
    - `X_std = X_train.std(axis=0, keepdims=True) + 1e-7`: Calculates the standard deviation of each pixel across all training images. A small value (1e-7) is added to avoid division by zero during normalization.
    - `X_train = (X_train - X_mean) / X_std`: Standardizes the training images by subtracting the mean (`X_mean`) and dividing by the standard deviation (`X_std`). This helps the model learn features more effectively.
    - `X_valid = (X_valid - X_mean) / X_std`: Applies the same standardization to the validation data using the previously calculated mean and standard deviation.
    - `X_test = (X_test - X_mean) / X_std`: Standardizes the test images using the same mean and standard deviation.

**4. Adding Channel Dimension (In [30])**

- Since Fashion MNIST images are grayscale, they have only one channel (representing intensity). This code adds a new dimension to represent this single channel.
    - `X_train = X_train[..., np.newaxis]`: This line adds a new axis at the last dimension (`...`) of the training images (`X_train`) using `np.newaxis`. This effectively creates a new dimension with a value of 1 for each image, representing the single channel.
    - `X_valid = X_valid[..., np.newaxis]`: Applies the same operation to the validation data.
    - `X_test = X_test[..., np.newaxis]`: Adds the channel dimension to the test data.

**5. Defining the CNN Model (In [31])**

- `from functools import partial`: Imports the `partial` function from the `functools` module for creating a partial function.
    - `DefaultConv2D = partial(keras.layers.Conv2D, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding="SAME")`: This line defines a custom function named `DefaultConv2D` using `partial`. This function creates a 2D convolutional layer with a kernel size of 3, ReLU activation, and "SAME" padding by default. This simplifies code by avoiding repetitive specification of these parameters.
- `model = keras.models.Sequential([ ... ])`: This line creates a sequential Keras model. The model architecture is defined within the square brackets `[]` as a list of layers.

**6. Model Architecture (In [31])**

The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dense layers, and dropout layers:

- **Convolutional Layers:** These layers extract features from the input images. The `DefaultConv2D` function is used to create convolutional layers with a kernel size of 3, ReLU activation, and "SAME" padding. The number of filters increases in deeper layers to capture more complex features.
- **Max Pooling Layers:** These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to reduce overfitting and computational cost.
- **Flatten Layer:** This layer flattens the output of the convolutional layers into a 1D array, preparing it for the dense layers.
- **Dense Layers:** These fully connected layers perform classification. The first two dense layers use ReLU activation and dropout for regularization. The final dense layer has 10 units (one for each class) and uses softmax activation to output class probabilities.

**7. Model Compilation (In [32])**

- `model.compile(loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", optimizer="nadam", metrics=["accuracy"])`: This line compiles the model:
    - `loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy"`: Specifies the loss function used to measure the model's performance. Sparse categorical crossentropy is suitable for multi-class classification problems where the labels are integers.
    - `optimizer="nadam"`: Specifies the optimizer used to update the model's weights during training. Nadam is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
    - `metrics=["accuracy"]`: Specifies the metric used to evaluate the model's performance. In this case, accuracy is used.

**8. Model Training (In [32])**

- `history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid))`: This line trains the model on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) for 10 epochs. The `validation_data` argument specifies the validation data (`X_valid`, `y_valid`) to monitor the model's performance during training. The training history is stored in the `history` object.

**9. Model Evaluation (In [32])**

- `score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)`: This line evaluates the trained model on the test data (`X_test`, `y_test`) and prints the loss and accuracy metrics.

**10. Making Predictions (In [32])**

- `X_new = X_test[:10]`: This line selects the first 10 images from the test set as new images to be classified.
- `y_pred = model.predict(X_new)`: This line uses the trained model to make predictions on the `X_new` images. The `y_pred` will contain the predicted class probabilities for each image.

This code effectively demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and use a CNN for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
